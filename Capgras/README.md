1. ****What is this game about?****
	- **Story**: A family of four become a family of three. With the loss of the oldest child, the family slowly started to break. 
		The youngest child, Joseph, starts to notice something strange happening around him.
		His normally calm and nice father begins to have angry outbursts.
		Now he hides in the wardrobes around his house to hide from his father.
		His cheery mother grows colder and colder each day.
		How can his family change this much? Is it possible that they aren't who he thinks they are?
		If so . . . where is his original family? Did his brother leave to look for them?
	- **Gameplay**: You will be navigating the house, advoiding the monstrous parents and other things lurking about. 
					The further you go, the more peices of the puzzle you will find. 
					Lets hope you do not find the same fate as the parents.
